      "from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Principles of Consolidation\n",
      "Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\n",
      "though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business\n",
      "enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests\n",
      "in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable\n",
      "interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of\n",
      "the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the\n",
      "obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n",
      "Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these\n",
      "VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although\n",
      "these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly\n",
      "impact the VIEs' economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for\n",
      "as consolidated entities.\n",
      "We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial\n",
      "policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the\n",
      "level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in\n",
      "policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.\n",
      "We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany\n",
      "portion of transactions with equity method investees.\n",
      "Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets\n",
      "Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in\n",
      "developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading \"Our Business — Challenges and Risks\" above and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result,\n",

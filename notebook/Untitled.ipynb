Let me see... The user provided a list of exhibits under certain file numbers and specified that they're under File No. 001-02217. Each exhibit is numbered from 3.1 to 48, each with references to specific sections or forms.\\n\\nFirst, I should go through each exhibit one by one to understand what each one includes. They all seem to be related to Coca-Cola's financial reports, indentures, and notes. The main ones are the Current Report on Form 10-Q (for Q3 2012), a Registration Statement S-3 (from Oct 25, 1993), several Indenture forms, and some Form of Note entries.\\n\\nI notice that each exhibit is numbered and has specific dates or form references. For example, 3.1 is incorporated by reference to the Current Report on Form 8-K for Q3 2012. Similarly, 4.1 is referenced to the Registration Statement S-3 from Oct 25, 1993.\\n\\nI should make sure I'm using the correct references and dates. Also, the exhibits are all included in a single file under File No. 001-02217, so they're likely related to Coca-Cola's ongoing operations or financial statements for that period.\\n\\nI think I need to create a concise summary that includes key elements from each exhibit without going into too much detail. Maybe start by mentioning the main sections of these reports and indentures, referencing the specific forms used.\\n\\nWait, but since all exhibits are included in one file, maybe it's better to list them together with their references. I should also mention any notes or agreements related to debt and equity issues.\\n\\nHmm, some of these forms like Form 8-K and S-3 are for SEC filings, so they must relate to Coca-Cola's SEC reporting. The Indenture forms seem to be agreements between the Company and others, which is a big part of the reports.\\n\\nI should also note that there's an agreement about debt instruments not being filed under certain rules, so that's important context for each indenture reference.\\n\\nLet me try to structure this: start with the main file number, then list each exhibit in order with their references. Each exhibit can be a separate point, but since they all refer to the same file, maybe just group them together.\\n\\nWait, but the user asked for a summary that includes all exhibits from 3.1 to 48, so perhaps I need to list all of them in one concise paragraph, each with their specific form and date references.\\n\\nI think that's manageable. Each exhibit is important because they address different aspects like debt indentures, notes, and registration rights. It's crucial for Coca-Cola to have these documents to manage its financial structures and register with the SEC.\\n\\nSo putting it all together: The exhibits include Coca-Cola's Current Report on Form 8-K, Registration Statement S-3, several Indenture forms, and multiple Form of Note entries. Each reference specifies the form number, date, or section referenced.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe exhibits provided under File No. 001-02217 document Coca-Cola's financial statements and agreements. Key components include:\\n\\n- **Current Report on Form 8-K (10-Q):** Filing details for Coca-Cola in 2012, covering quarterly performance.\\n- **Registration Statement S-3:** Form of Registration, filed on October 25, 1993, related to Coca-Cola's stock offering.\\n- **Indenture Forms (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc.):** Agreements between the Company and entities like Deutsche Bank, including modifications for debt instruments not being filed under specific SEC rules.\\n- **Form of Note:**\\n  - Notes on various interest rates and maturities, such as 5.350%, 4.875%, and others, all referenced to Form of Note (10-Q) or Registration Statement S-3.\\n\\nThese exhibits are part of Coca-Cola's financial filings under a single file number, addressing its debt structure, equity rights, and SEC reporting obligations.\"),\n",

The user provided eight sections: 4.13 through 4.18, each with different note details and exhibits referenced.\\n\\nFirst, I notice that all the notes are about various forms of notes for specific maturities and due dates. The notes themselves mention terms like \"Floating Rate Notes,\" which I think means those notes have variable interest rates tied to an index. They also talk about exculpatory warranties, which probably cover any claims against interest rate changes.\\n\\nLooking at the exhibits referenced (exhibit 4.6, 4.4, etc.), they likely contain details on how each form of note is structured and its obligations. The dates mentioned are important for understanding the timing of payments or any changes in conditions affecting these notes.\\n\\nI need to condense this information into clear summaries without losing the key points. Each summary should mention the type of note, its maturity date, the interest rate structure (fixed vs. floating), any exclusions (exculpatory warranties), and the reference text for more details on each form.\\n\\nMaybe I can group similar notes together. For example, Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes are two main categories. Each has different maturities like 1.650%, 2.500%, etc., and their respective interest rates (fixed or floating).\\n\\nI should also note that each form is referenced from a specific current report on Form 8-K, which probably contains the detailed information for each exhibit. That means the summaries need to include references to these reports for accuracy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I can create summaries for each note type, specifying the maturity date, interest rate details (fixed or floating), any exclusions, and linking them back to the referenced exhibits.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere are concise summaries of the provided notes:\\n\\n1. **Fixed Rate Notes**:\\n   - Maturity Date: Varies by note type (e.g., 1.650%, 2.500%, etc.).\\n   - Interest Rate Structure: Fixed for all durations until maturity.\\n\\n2. **Floating Rate Notes**:\\n   - Maturity Dates: Typically range from March 2014 to November 2013.\\n   - Interest Rate Structure: Floating, tied to a specified index (e.g., yield on 3-month U.S. Treasury notes).\\n   - Exculpatory Warranties: Included in each form\\'s reference text for the respective exhibits.\\n\\nThese summaries summarize each note type by their maturity dates and interest rate structures, linking them to the referenced exhibits that provide detailed information.'),\n",

Let me start by reading through everything carefully.\\n\\nFirst, there are several tables that reference exhibits from different sections of the Coca-Cola Company's Current Report on Form 8-K. The first table mentions a form of note due in 2018, another for 2020, etc., each incorporated by reference to specific exhibits. Then there's one about the Performance Incentive Plan, which has three subsections with their own tables incorporating different exhibits.\\n\\nI should make sure to include all these entries in the summary, highlighting that some are merged under a single exhibit number and others have separate ones. Also, I need to mention the dates for each note due and the reference date for the Performance Incentive Plan.\\n\\nLet me check if I've covered everything: The user provided several table headers with their respective dates, each linked to an exhibit. They also mentioned the Performance Incentive Plan separately, which is another entry in the summary.\\n\\nI think that's all.

The user has provided three exhibits that are part of the Coca-Cola Company\\'s financial reports for different restricted stock award plans. Each exhibit seems to be a table with details about these plans, including years in effect, total proceeds from stock options, market price per share, number of shares granted, vesting period, vesting rate, purchase price per share, performance thresholds, vesting start dates, vesting dates, vesting period, and compensation costs.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each exhibit is about. Each one talks about a specific year (1983, 1989, 2014) under the Coca-Cola Company\\'s stock options. The exhibits are incorporated by reference from the company\\'s current reports on Form 8-K filed in 1983, 2011, and 2014 respectively.\\n\\nSince each exhibit is a table summarizing data about these plans, my task is to condense this information into concise summaries. I should focus on key points such as the years, total proceeds, market price, shares granted, vesting periods, vesting rates, purchase price thresholds, and costs.\\n\\nI need to ensure that I don\\'t include all the details from each table but instead provide a clear and accurate summary that highlights the main data points. Maybe I can list each exhibit separately with their key elements. Also, since all exhibits are incorporated by reference, it\\'s important to mention that they\\'re based on Form 8-K filings.\\n\\nI should structure my response clearly, perhaps number each exhibit for easy reading. For each, I\\'ll note the years, total proceeds, and any significant thresholds or rates. It might also be helpful to mention the vesting dates in both years where applicable.\\n\\nWait, but looking back at the user\\'s previous query, they had a specific format with bullet points under \"Summary of Table/Text 10.4...\" So maybe I should follow that structure. Each exhibit will have its own bullet points listing key details like year, total proceeds, market price, etc.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the language is concise and that each point stands out clearly so that it\\'s easy to read. Avoiding unnecessary jargon unless it\\'s part of the summary might help keep it straightforward.\\n\\nHmm, I should double-check if there are any specific years or notable points in each exhibit that stand out. For example, checking if the vesting periods vary between 2014 and 2011 or 1983, which would be interesting to note as a summary point.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that I don\\'t mix up the years from different exhibits. Each exhibits\\' years are distinct: 1983, 2011, and 2014. So in my summaries, I should mention each separately but make sure they\\'re correct based on the exhibits provided.\\n\\nAnother thing is to make sure that all key data points like total proceeds from stock options, market price per share, number of shares, etc., are included accurately in each bullet point.\\n\\nI think I have a good grasp now. I\\'ll structure each exhibit as bullet points with clear labels, mention the years from each exhibit, include the important details about proceeds, market prices, thresholds, vesting periods, start dates, and costs. Also, since they\\'re incorporated by reference to Form 8-K reports, I should note that part in the summary.\\n\\nI need to make sure my summaries are concise and don\\'t repeat information unnecessarily. Maybe each exhibit will have its own set of bullet points listing key facts without overlapping with others.\\n\\nLet me outline the structure: three exhibits, each a section with bullet points for details. Each bullet point should be clear and highlight specific data from that table or text. Also, include notes like \"Based on Form 8-K Report\" after each exhibit to clarify their origin.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got all the elements covered.

The first thing that comes to mind is checking if all the information is correctly capitalized and spelled out.\\n\\nLooking at each bullet item, for example: \"10.6.1 Form of Restricted Stock Agreement... incorporated hereby...\". I notice that the numbers aren\\'t properly separated by periods or commas where they should be. In legal documents, section references usually have a period after the number for clarity, like 4.1, not 4.1.\\n\\nAlso, looking at the numbering in each bullet point—each is numbered as 10.6.1 and so on. But when I check standard practice, it\\'s common to use periods instead of commas between section numbers. So \"10.6.1\" should be written with a period after both numbers.\\n\\nFurthermore, the overall structure seems a bit off grammatically. For example, in some documents, there might be missing punctuation or inconsistent capitalization. The user has provided a summary that\\'s not formatted correctly, so it\\'s important to ensure consistency and proper grammar throughout the summary.\\n\\nI also wonder if all the exhibits are properly incorporated by reference in their respective sections. It looks like each bullet point lists an exhibit number followed by its text, which is correct as long as they align with the current report.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is whether any of these dates or agreements were adopted after February 2017, given that the Current Report was filed on February 18, 2010. The user\\'s later points mention different adoption years like January 2015 and January 2013, so it\\'s possible that some agreements were adopted before the report was filed.\\n\\nBut I think the main focus here is about formatting the summary correctly rather than analyzing each specific agreement\\'s details beyond what\\'s provided in the exhibits. However, without access to the actual content of Exhibits 10.1-10.14, it\\'s a bit challenging to verify each point fully, but based on the information given, there are a few areas that need attention: spacing around periods and commas between section numbers and possibly inconsistent capitalization.\\n\\nTo make sure the summary is accurate, I should probably double-check each bullet point for proper formatting. That way, anyone reading it can understand where each subsection is located within the document without getting lost in messy punctuation or missing sections.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe user provided a detailed list of table or text chunks from exhibits, with specific references to sections and subsections in the Company\\'s Current Report on Form 8-K. Here’s how you can summarize this information accurately:\\n\\n1. **Form of Restricted Stock Agreement**  \\n   - In connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 17, 2010: incorporated hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n2. **Performance Share Unit Agreement**  \\n   - In connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 17, 2010: incorporated hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n3. **Performance Share Unit Agreement for France**  \\n   - In connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 17, 2010: incorporated hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n4. **Form of Restricted Stock Agreement (Performance Share Unit Agreement)** in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 16, 2011: incorporated hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n5. **Performance Share Unit Agreement** for France in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 16, 2011: incorporated hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n6. **Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (Performance Share Unit Agreement)** in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporated hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n7. **Performing Share Unit Agreement** in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporated hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n8. **Form of Performance Share Unit Agreement** (for France) in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporate hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n9. **Performing Share Unit Agreement for France** in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporate hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n10. **Form of Performance Share Unit Agreement (for France)** in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporate hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n11. **Performing Share Unit Agreement** for France in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporate hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n12. **Form of Performing Share Unit Agreement (for France)** in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporate hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n13. **Performing Share Unit Agreement** in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporate hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\n14. **Form of Performing Share Unit Agreement (for France)** in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, as adopted February 15, 2012: incorporate hereby to exhibit exhibits.\\n\\nThis summary highlights all the relevant sections and subsections from the exhibits, ensuring proper formatting and clarity.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'year': 2015, 'company': 'coca-cola', 'filings': '10-K filings', 'filename': '2015-cocacola-10k-filing.pdf', 'page_number': 148, 'section': 'unknown', 'doc_id': 'a76d67aa-4257-4d35-a391-4c0197c0b9f4', 'summary': True}, page_content='<think>\\nOkay, so I\\'ve been given this task where I need to summarize a set of tables and text from exhibits related to stock options for Coca-Cola. Let me try to unpack what each part is asking.\\n\\nFirst, there are several exhibits listed with their respective years. Each exhibit seems to be a form of a restricted stock agreement or unit agreement for the Coca-Cola Company. The years range from 2013 and later in 2014 up until 1995. That\\'s quite a span over time—over two centuries!\\n\\nI notice that each exhibit is prefixed with \"10.6.15\" and so on, which probably indicates the specific section or form within the report where these exhibits are located. For example, \"10.6.15 Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement...\" is under the Coca-Cola Equity Plan from April 23, 2014.\\n\\nThe key point I\\'m trying to extract here is that all these exhibits are part of the equity plans for Coca-Cola, specifically the stock options related to their restricted stock awards. These agreements likely control or grant shares in the company through restricted stock units (RSUs) instead of a full share purchase. The companies included are Coca-Cola and perhaps others, though the focus seems to be on Coca-Cola.\\n\\nLooking at the last exhibit, \"10.8 The Coca-Cola Company Compensation Deferral & Investment Program of the Company, as amended...\" from November 28, 1995, this suggests that there\\'s an ongoing program related to employee compensation, including potential deferrals or investments. But since it\\'s from 1995 and the next equity plan is from 2013, there might be changes in these programs over time.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit confused about the timing here. If all these exhibits are included from 1995 to 2014, that\\'s 20 years—way too long if they\\'re all part of the same entity. Maybe each exhibit is separate? Or perhaps it\\'s an oversight in referencing; maybe some are for the Coca-Cola Equity Plan and others for different entities or later plans.\\n\\nWait, actually, I see several exhibits under the Coca-Cola Equity Plan, from 2014 back to 1995. That could be part of a multi-reporting period covering a longer time frame than intended. Alternatively, perhaps some are specific to Coca-Cola and others are for other companies or entities that used similar structures.\\n\\nI think the main takeaway is that all these exhibits deal with stock options, which control equity through RSUs, starting back in 1995 for Coca-Cola\\'s programs and continuing through the Coca-Cola Equity Plan until 2014. The fact that they are part of multiple reports suggests a consistent system for valuing and accounting for these shares over time.\\n\\nI need to ensure I\\'m summarizing each exhibit accurately but keep it concise since the instruction was to summarize tables or text with a focus on key points like dates, company names, types of agreements, etc. I should mention that they\\'re all part of equity options linked to restricted stock units, starting from 1995 and ending in 2014.\\n\\nWait, but the last exhibit is \"The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan...\" which comes after several others under the same equity plan. Maybe each year\\'s exhibits are separate reports for different entities or for the same entity over time? That might be stretching it, though—Coca-Cola likely has consistent structures in its equity plans.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to remember if I saw something about a long period of stock options from 1995 through 2014 being included in the reports. It\\'s possible that some of these were part of the same annual report for Coca-Cola, covering different entities or time periods within the year. But since all are under \"Coca-Cola\", it could be indicating a broader program over multiple years.\\n\\nIn any case, the main task is to note each exhibit as related to equity options from 1995 through 2014, focusing on key elements like form type (unit or agreement), company name, and dates. I need to make sure not to mix up the types—some are agreements, others are forms of stock units.\\n\\nI think that\\'s about it. Now, structuring the summary to highlight these exhibits as part of Coca-Cola\\'s equity options from 1995 onward.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe exhibits listed correspond to equity options ( Restricted Stock Units or Stock Agreement Forms) for Coca-Cola starting from November 28, 1995, and continuing through the Coca-Cola Equity Plan as of April 23, 2014. Each exhibit pertains to a different form of stock agreements, including restricted stock unit agreements and performance share unit agreements. The key elements include dates (from 1995 to 2014), company names (Coca-Cola), types of agreements (forms or units), and references to specific reports such as annual statements.'),\n",

The date is given as September 27, 2012, so that's probably the latest date I need to include.\\n\\nNext is a Letter Agreement with Dr Pepper Seven-Up, Inc., dated June 7, 2010. It references Exhibit 10.1 from the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which was filed on June 7, 2010. So this date seems to be exact.\\n\\nThen there are a few stock options and awards plans for Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. The first one is a Stock Option Plan with the number 99.4, referenced from an Registration Statement on Form S-8 with registration number 333-169722, filed on October 1, 2010. The others are similar but have slightly different numbers and dates: 99.5, 99.6, all referencing the same form.\\n\\nSo putting it together, these seem like forms of stock options or awards that Coca-Cola offers in exchange for shares or other equity instruments.

Let me try to understand what each part is about.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the table numbered 10.30.1, it's related to forms of a stock option agreement for senior officers under the Incentive Award Plan in 2007. The reference is to an exhibit from Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc.'s annual report in 2007. I know that stock options are usually linked to performance, so this must be about shares given out as incentives or something like that.\\n\\nThen there's another table on 10.30.2 which is similar but for the period ending 2008. It also references an exhibit from the same company and its 2008 annual report. So, it seems like these are ongoing agreements over time.\\n\\nThe next set of tables (10.30.3 to 10.30.5) cover different forms for 2007 and then after October 29, 2008, with exhibits from 2008 reports as well. So these are likely to be ongoing agreements with the company over time.\\n\\nLooking at 10.31, there's a table related to an employee savings plan that was amended in January 2010. It mentions exhibits for 2009 and 2010 reports. The form includes first, second, third, and fourth amendments, each with dates. So this is about a defined contribution pension plan where employees contribute money to their retirement accounts.\\n\\nThen there are more tables under 10.31, specifically 10.31.1 through 10.31.5, which detail each amendment's date. Each is referencing different exhibits from subsequent annual reports.\\n\\nNext, there's a table on Coca-Cola Refreshments Executive Pension Plan in 2010 with amendments from 2011 onwards. This seems like another defined contribution plan for executives, but this time it's an executive plan rather than an employee pension plan.\\n\\nI also need to check if all these are related to the same company, Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc., and that each exhibit is linked to their respective annual reports. The references go back quite some years from 2007 to 2011, so this seems like a long-term strategic plan or financial report.\\n\\nI should make sure I don't miss any of the key points: the form of agreements over time (for options and pension plans), the dates of amendments, and that all relate to Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. The user might be looking for an overview of their financial structure, particularly regarding incentives and employee benefits.\\n\\nI should also note that each exhibit is referenced from specific reports, which suggests this is part of a larger report or document that's being updated over time with changes in company performance, strategies, etc.\\n\\nI wonder if there's any mention of how these agreements affect the company's financials. Maybe they are tied to stock option exercises or payouts, but without more context, it's hard to say. I should assume that each form is a part of their compensation and benefits strategy.\\n\\nLastly, the user might be looking for an easy summary that highlights key points about incentives, pension plans, and how these structures change over time. It's important to capture both the current status (at least 2010) and some historical context (earlier years).\\n\\nAlright, putting this together into a concise summary, I need to cover each table, noting their form, purpose, reference point, and key dates.

The user provided three amendments: 10.32, 10.33, and two amendments related to the offer letter. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each part is asking for. The user wants a concise summary of these tables and text chunks. Each table is numbered (10.32.2, etc.), so it seems like they're dealing with amendments or changes in the company's financial structures.\\n\\nLooking at 10.32, it mentions that this amendment was incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.46.3 from the annual report for December 31, 2011. I think this is a form of incorporation clause where an exhibit is referenced in the annual report, which usually happens when they are incorporating a new section or change.\\n\\nThen there's 10.33, which mentions another reference to exhibit 10.49 from the annual report for December 31, 2010. This seems similar—another incorporated reference after incorporation changes in the same company but in an earlier year.\\n\\nThe next part is about amendments related to employee benefit plans. Each has its own reference: 10.46, 10.49, and two more references (10.50 and 10.1) from their respective annual reports. These probably outline changes in the structure of the employee benefits or the form they are incorporated by reference.\\n\\nThe last part is about an offer letter that was included in another exhibit from the current report for September 2014. It seems like a contract between the company and someone named Steven A. Cahillane, detailing confidentiality, non-competition, and non-solicitation clauses.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I need to write a summary that includes each amendment, their incorporation references, and any additional information about the offer letter. The user probably needs this for quick understanding without diving into detailed tables or exhibits.\\n\\nI should make sure to mention each section clearly: the amendments, their dates, inclusion of relevant exhibits from the reports, and maybe a note on the offer letter's purpose. Keeping it concise but informative is key here.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe documents describe amendments made to the Coca-Cola Refreshments Executive Pension Plan and certain employee benefit plans and equity plans as well as an offer letter between the company and Steven A. Cahillane. The amendments include incorporate by reference exhibits from the 2011 and 2010 annual reports, and the offer letter incorporates references from the 2012 current report.\"),\n",

They\\'re included in exhibits of the annual and quarterly reports.\\n\\nI need to make sure I\\'m summarizing this correctly, especially considering the numbering and bullet points. Maybe I can group related information together for clarity.\\n\\nLet me think about the structure. The main point is the severance pay plan adjustments. Then, there are two notices from the company regarding those changes.\\n\\nHmm, should I mention that each letter is part of an exhibit? Or is it better to list them as separate notes? Since they\\'re references to exhibits, maybe it\\'s good to note their inclusion without rewriting.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the summary doesn\\'t get too wordy. Each bullet point can be a sentence or two explaining what each number refers to.\\n\\nWait, I should make sure that the start dates are correctly noted and included in the summary.

It seems like each point is about different letters or events, so they should be treated separately.\\n\\nI think I have a good structure now: main heading, followed by bullet points with each number explaining its content.

When we record our proportionate share of net income, it increases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and our carrying value in that investment. Conversely, when we record our proportionate share of a net loss, it decreases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and our carrying value in that investment. The Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees includes significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees. These items can have a significant impact on the amount of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and our carrying value in those investments. Refer to Note 17 for additional information related to significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also impacted by our proportionate share of items impacting the equity investee's AOCI.\n",

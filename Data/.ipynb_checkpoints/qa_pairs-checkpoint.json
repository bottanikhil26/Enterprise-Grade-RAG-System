We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of\nstill beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. We own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic\nsparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200\ncountries.",

Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200\ncountries.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations as well as\nindependent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers \u2014 the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 1.9\nbillion of the approximately 57 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends\non the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets \u2014 our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates \u2014\nto become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners.\nWe were incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been organized in 1892.\n1",
        "5": "Acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s Former North America Business and Related Transactions\nOn October 2, 2010, we acquired the former North America business of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (\"CCE\"), one of our major bottlers, consisting of CCE's production, sales and distribution\noperations in the United States, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and a substantial majority of CCE's corporate segment. CCE\nshareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity named Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (\"New CCE\"), which, after the closing of the\ntransaction, continued to hold the European operations that had been held by CCE prior to the acquisition. The Company does not have any ownership interest in New CCE. Upon completion of\nthe CCE transaction, we combined the management of the acquired North America business with the management of our existing foodservice business; Minute Maid and Odwalla juice\nbusinesses; North America supply chain operations; and Company-owned bottling operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a unified bottling and customer service organization called Coca-\nCola Refreshments (\"CCR\"). In addition, we reshaped our remaining Coca-Cola North America operations into an organization that primarily provided franchise leadership and consumer\nmarketing and innovation for the North American market. Effective January 1, 2014, our North America business was restructured to consist of two operating units, Coca-Cola North America and\nCCR. Coca-Cola North America provides franchise leadership and consumer marketing and innovation and will also manage our foodservice operations. CCR manages our North America\nbottling operations and the product supply chain functions for the North American market. Our two North America operating units have distinct capabilities, responsibilities and strengths, but\noperate as a unified, aligned and agile organization.\nIn contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCE's former North America business, we reached an agreement with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (\"DPSG\") to distribute certain DPSG\nbrands in territories where DPSG brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPSG, concurrently with the closing of the CCE",

Under the terms of our agreement with DPSG, concurrently with the closing of the CCE\ntransaction, we entered into license agreements with DPSG to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the United States, Canada Dry in the Northeastern United States, and Canada Dry and C'\nPlus in Canada, and we made a net one-time cash payment of $715 million to DPSG. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute\nDPSG products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20-year renewal periods unless otherwise\nterminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPSG and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In\naddition, we entered into an agreement with DPSG to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The\nCoca-Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years.\nOn October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in Coca-Cola Drikker AS (the \"Norwegian bottling operation\") and Coca-Cola Drycker Sverige AB (the \"Swedish bottling operation\") to\nNew CCE for $0.9 billion in cash.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company's operating structure is the basis for our internal financial reporting. As of December 31, 2014, our operating structure included the following operating segments, the first six of\nwhich are sometimes referred to as \"operating groups\" or \"groups\":\n\u2022 Eurasia and\nAfrica\n\u2022 Europe\n\u2022 Latin\nAmerica\n\u2022 North\nAmerica\n\u2022 Asia\nPacific\n\u2022 Bottling\nInvestments\n\u2022 Corporate\nExcept to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, the description of our business in this report is presented on a\nconsolidated basis.\nFor financial information about our operating segments and geographic areas, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, \"Item 8.

Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides\nmarketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We\nbelieve unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this\nreport are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases\nexpressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth\nrates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and\nchanges in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the\nitems mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups may\ngive rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.\nDistribution System and Bottler's Agreements\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations as well as\nindependent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers \u2014 the world's largest beverage distribution system.

In some instances, we have agreed or may in the future agree with a bottler with respect to concentrate pricing on a prospective basis for specified\ntime periods. Certain Bottler's Agreements, entered into prior to 1987, provide for concentrates or syrups for certain Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark\nBeverages to be priced pursuant to a stated formula. Bottlers that accounted for 6.3 percent of total unit case volume in the United States in 2014 have contracts for certain Trademark Coca-Cola\nBeverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages with pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the\nCompany, up to a maximum indexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. Bottlers that accounted for 0.3 percent of total\nunit case volume in the United States in 2014 operate under our oldest form of contract, which provides for a fixed price for Coca-Cola syrup used in bottles and cans. This price is subject to\nquarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the quoted price of sugar.",

All of these standard contracts give the Company complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale.\nIn addition to the Bottler's Agreements described above, in 2014, the Company and certain bottlers entered into comprehensive beverage agreements (\"CBAs\") under which the bottlers are\nauthorized to purchase Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or another supplier authorized by the Company and to distribute, promote, market and sell such beverages, on an\n7",

Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we\nprovide promotional and marketing services and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements. The\naggregate amount of funds provided by our Company to bottlers, resellers or other customers of our Company's products, principally for participation in promotional and marketing programs, was\n$7.0 billion in 2014.\nInvestments in Bottling Operations\nMost of our branded beverage products outside of North America are manufactured, sold and distributed by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of\nbottling or canning operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to\ncompensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler\u2019s sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler\u2019s business and information systems; and establish an\nappropriate capital structure for the bottler.

In 2014, we began the implementation of a new business model in the United States which includes more rational and contiguous operating territories; grants of\nexclusive territory rights and the sale by us of distribution assets and cold-drink equipment to the bottlers; a finished goods model under which production assets remain with us, which facilitates\nfuture implementation of a national product supply system; an improved, more integrated information technology platform; and a new beverage agreement, the CBA (refer to \"Bottler's\nAgreements Within the United States\" above for more information regarding the CBA), that will support the evolving operating model.\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the\nCoca-Cola system\u2019s production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net revenues and profits at\nthe bottler level, which in turn generate increased concentrate sales for our Company\u2019s concentrate and syrup business.

In the United States, the principal nutritive sweetener is high fructose corn syrup\n(\"HFCS\"), which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. HFCS is available from numerous domestic sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. The principal nutritive\nsweetener used by our business outside the United States is sucrose, i.e., table sugar, which is also available from numerous sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market\nprice. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our bottlers'\nrequirements with the assistance of Coca-Cola Bottlers' Sales & Services Company LLC (\"CCBSS\").

The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists.\nProposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable\nquantitative threshold below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject\nan affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in\nquestion exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is below a \u201csafe harbor\u201d threshold that may be established, is naturally occurring, is the result of necessary cooking or is\nsubject to another applicable exception.

Management believes that the total liabilities to the Company that may arise as a\nresult of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\nAqua-Chem Litigation\nOn December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. 2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia (the\n\"Georgia Case\"), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc. (\"Aqua-Chem\"), for any past,\npresent or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem. Subsequent to the Company's filing but on the same day, Aqua-Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua-\nChem, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Company, Civil Action No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (the \"Wisconsin Case\"). In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua-\nChem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not covered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem's general and product\nliability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company's sale of Aqua-Chem in 1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by Aqua-\nChem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case initially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-\nChem.\nThe Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for some of its prior and\nfuture costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of a stock sale agreement. The 1981\nagreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties' rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and lawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a\ndivision of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has\napproximately 40,000 active claims pending against it.",

Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has\napproximately 40,000 active claims pending against it.\nThe parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the coverage action, five\nplaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of\nMilwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the subject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company\nduring the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination of the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with\nregard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary judgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers,\none with a $15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million policy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the Company and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-\nChem's asbestos liabilities before any obligation is triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.\nAqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were jointly and severally\nliable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on other defenses that might apply. During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation, Aqua-Chem and the Company reached\nsettlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who have paid or will pay funds into an escrow account for payment of costs arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On\nJuly 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant\ninsurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy is triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem's",

The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy is triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem's\nlosses up to policy limits. The court's judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\nThe Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did not settle in the\nWisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company anticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers (the \u201cChartis insurers\u201d) would be finalized in May 2011, but the Chartis\ninsurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them in Wisconsin state court to enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in\nthe alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment validating Aqua-Chem and the Company's interpretation of the court's judgment in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\nIn February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the exhaustion of\npolicies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010 Term Sheet were not binding\ncontracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs' claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem on that one open issue and entered a final appealable judgment to that effect\nfollowing the parties' settlement. On January 23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court's summary judgment ruling. On October 29, 2013, the Wisconsin Court of\nAppeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem. On November 27, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of\nWisconsin, and on December 11, 2013, the Company filed its opposition to that petition. On April 16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin denied the Chartis insurers' petition for review.\nThe Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004.\nEnvironmental Matter\nThe Company's Atlanta Syrup Plant (\u201cASP\u201d) discharges wastewater to a City of Atlanta wastewater treatment works pursuant to a government-issued permit under the U.S. Clean Water Act and\nrelated state and local laws and regulations. The Company became aware that wastewater-related reports filed by ASP with regulators may contain certain inaccurate information and in November\n2012 made self-disclosure to the City of Atlanta regarding the matter as required by applicable law. As a result, regulatory authorities are seeking monetary and/or other sanctions against the\nCompany. The Company is in the process of negotiating a mutually acceptable settlement with the regulatory authorities and believes that any sanctions that may ultimately be imposed will not be\nmaterial to its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n \nITEM 4.

We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of\nstill beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. We own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic\nsparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200\ncountries.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling\npartners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers \u2014 the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 1.9 billion of the\napproximately 57 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our success further\ndepends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets \u2014 our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates \u2014\nto become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n\u2022 beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate business\" or \"concentrate\noperations\"); and\n\u2022 finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product business\" or \"finished product\noperations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our",

The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers \u2014 such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles \u2014 bearing\nour trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers.

Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace,\nwe create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In developing a strategy\nfor a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. Our integrated marketing\nactivities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point-of-sale merchandising and sales promotions.\nWe are focusing on marketing strategies to drive volume growth in emerging markets, increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our developed markets. In emerging\nmarkets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our\nfocus is on differentiating our brands.

There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government\nagencies about the health problems associated with obesity, which results from poor diets that are too high in calories combined with inactive lifestyles. This concern represents a significant\nchallenge to our industry. We understand and recognize that obesity is a complex public health challenge and are committed to being a part of the solution.\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers\u2019 lifestyles and dietary choices. All of our products can be part of an active, healthy lifestyle that includes a sensible and balanced diet, proper hydration\nand regular physical activity. However, when it comes to weight management, all calories count, whatever food or beverage they come from, including calories from our beverages.\nThe following four global initiatives will guide our efforts to address obesity and bring people together to pursue solutions:\n\u2022\nOffer low- or no-calorie beverage\noptions\n\u2022\nProvide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of all of our\npackages\n\u2022\nHelp get people moving by supporting physical activity\nprograms\n\u2022\nMarket responsibly, including no advertising to children under\n12\nWe recognize the health of our business is interwoven with the well-being of our consumers, our employees and the communities we serve, and we are working in cooperation with governments,\neducators and consumers.\nWater Quality and Quantity\nWater quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our Company\u2019s attention and collaboration with other companies, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations and\ncommunities where we operate.

We regularly assess the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face\nand have implemented a formal water risk management program. We are actively collaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate\nfor needed water policy reforms and action to protect water availability and quality around the world. We are working with our global partners to develop and implement sustainability-related\nwater projects that address local needs.

        "89": "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Principles of\nConsolidation\n\u2022 Recoverability of Noncurrent\nAssets\n\u2022 Pension Plan\nValuations\n\u2022 Revenue\nRecognition\n\u2022 Income\nTaxes\nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. While our\nestimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For\na discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally,\nwe consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition\nof consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through\narrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential\nrewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a\n\"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.",

Our variable interests in\nthese VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted\nin our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our Company's\ninvestments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $2,274 million and $2,171 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing our maximum exposures\nto loss.

        "91": "Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and/or\nimpairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more\nfrequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its\nproportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) \u2014 net in our consolidated statements of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate\nshare of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\nManagement's assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include\ninherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales\nvolume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets.\nThese factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with\nthose we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent\nwith what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a\nnumber of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.

Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result.\nRefer to the heading \"Operations Review\" below for additional information related to our present business environment. Certain factors discussed above are impacted by our current business\nenvironment and are discussed throughout this report, as appropriate.\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing or emerging\nmarkets. Refer to the heading \"Our Business \u2014 Challenges and Risks\" above and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which\ninvolve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\nThe carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. We account for investments in companies that we do\nnot control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable.

The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value.\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary.

Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility,\nwhich is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as \"business\nunits.\" These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic\nlocation, except for bottling operations managed by CCR, which are included in our North America operating segment. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\nThe goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill.

Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the\nimpairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also\nnegatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a\nhypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless\nof whether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed.

The Company\nallocated $3.3 billion of the purchase price to various trademarks acquired in this business combination. While the combined fair value of the various trademarks acquired in this transaction\nsignificantly exceeds their combined carrying values as of December 31, 2014, the fair value of one trademark within the portfolio has declined and now approximates its carrying value.

In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various\npension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States.\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and related obligation.

The revised assumptions\nwere derived from the mortality tables and the mortality improvement scales published by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014. The change in mortality assumptions for the U.S. plans resulted\nin an increase in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2014, of approximately $210 million.\nIn 2014, the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $34 million. In 2015, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $134 million. The anticipated\nincrease is primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the Company's benefit obligation, unfavorable asset performance compared to our expected return\nduring 2014 and the adoption of more conservative mortality assumptions for U.S. plans offset by the impact of approximately $90 million of contributions the Company expects to make in 2015\nto its international plans. The estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2015 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $47 million.\nAdditionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on our 2015 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of\napproximately $31 million.\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans.

As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in our\nconsolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax\nreturn, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined\nbased on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in\neffect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net\noperating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the\nreversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be\nestablished unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.

As of December 31, 2014, the\nCompany's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $649 million and primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards\ngenerated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these\ndeferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these\njurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income\nto realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results\nfrom earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the\namount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of\ncash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected\ncash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and\napproval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk.

This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax\nrate in 2015.\n \nOperations Review\nOur organizational structure as of December 31, 2014, consisted of the following operating segments, the first six of which are sometimes referred to as \"operating groups\" or \"groups\": Eurasia and\nAfrica; Europe; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments, refer to Note 19 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing\noperations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key\nmetrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance.\n42",
        "110": "Unit case volume growth is a metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case\nvolume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and,\ntherefore, reflects unit case volume for consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below.\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling\npartners or other customers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below.\nOur Bottling Investments operating segment and our other finished product operations, including the finished product operations in our North America operating segment, typically generate net\noperating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water\nproducts, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain\nretailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who\nresell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these consolidated finished product operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case\nequivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these\nconcentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations, and we typically\nreport unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the",

When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the\nfollowing four factors: (1) volume growth (unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as appropriate), (2) structural changes, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and (4) foreign\ncurrency fluctuations. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below.\n\"Structural changes\" generally refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling, distribution or canning entities\nfor accounting purposes. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case\nvolume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments\noperating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations.\nIn 2014, the Company began implementing a new beverage partnership model in North America. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we refranchised territories that were previously\nmanaged by CCR to certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of operating results for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014. In addition, for non-Company-owned and licensed beverage products sold in the refranchised territories, we have eliminated the unit case volume and associated concentrate\nsales from the base year when calculating 2014 versus 2013 volume growth rates on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America segment. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the\nCompany made a decision to change our process of buying and selling recyclable materials in North America.

This transfer is included as a\nstructural change in our analysis of operating results for our Bottling Investments segment for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we have eliminated the unit case volume and\nassociated concentrate sales from the base year when calculating 2014 versus 2013 volume growth rates on a consolidated basis as well as for our Eurasia and Africa and Bottling Investments\nsegments related to certain brands owned by the Russian juice company that have been discontinued as a result of this transition. Refer to the headings \"Beverage Volume\" and \"Net Operating\nRevenues\" below.\nIn January 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted a new law (\"Fair Price Law\") that imposes limits on profit margins earned in the country, which limited the amount of revenue the Company\nwas able to recognize in 2014 as compared to 2013.

Refer to the heading \"Net Operating\nRevenues\" below.\nThe Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing\nconcentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate\nsales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our\nunconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the\nfinished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for\nthe unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions until the equity method investee has sold finished products\nmanufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer.\n\"Acquired brands\" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired\nbrands in periods prior to the closing of the transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not\ngenerally consider acquired brands to be structural changes.\n\"Licensed brands\" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an\neconomic benefit when these brands are ultimately sold.

We do not\ngenerally consider new licensed brands to be structural changes.\n \nBeverage Volume\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, \"unit case\" means a unit of\nmeasurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage\nproducts directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in\nunit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from\nthe sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is\none of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on\nestimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit\ncases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal\nduring any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact\nunit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.

The increase in\nadvertising expenses reflects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands. This increase was partially offset by a foreign currency exchange impact of 4 percent. The decrease in\nbottling and distribution expenses is a result of the refranchising of certain territories in North America in 2014 and the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations as a result of their\ncombination with an independent bottling partner in July 2013.\nIn 2015, our pension expense is expected to increase by approximately $100 million compared to 2014.

        "169": "Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the\nremeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) \u2014 net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the\nheading \"Operations Review \u2014 Other Income (Loss) \u2014 Net\" above. The Company recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $569 million, $162 million and $2 million in 2014, 2013 and\n2012, respectively.\nHyperinflationary Economies\nA hyperinflationary economy is one that has cumulative inflation of 100 percent or more over a three-year period. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,\nlocal subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies are required to use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in U.S. dollars\nusing the rate applicable to conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances. All exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized currently in income.\nVenezuela has been designated as a hyperinflationary economy. In February 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency to an official rate of exchange (\"official rate\") of 6.3 bolivars\nper U.S. dollar. At that time, the Company remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary at the official rate. As a result of the devaluation, we recognized a loss of $140 million\nfrom remeasurement in the line item other income (loss) \u2014 net in our consolidated statement of income.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government recognized three legal exchange rates to convert bolivars to the U.S. dollar: 1) the official rate of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar; 2)\nSICAD 1, which is available to foreign investments and designated industry sectors to exchange a limited volume of bolivars for U.S. dollars using a bid rate established at weekly auctions; and 3)\nSICAD 2, which applies to transactions that do not qualify for either the official rate or SICAD 1. As of March 28, 2014, the three legal exchange rates were 6.3 (official rate), 10.8 (SICAD 1) and",

As of March 28, 2014, the three legal exchange rates were 6.3 (official rate), 10.8 (SICAD 1) and\n50.9 (SICAD 2). We determined that the SICAD 1 rate was the most appropriate rate to use for remeasurement given our circumstances and estimates of the applicable\n67",
        "171": "rate at which future transactions could be settled, including the payment of dividends. Therefore, as of March 28, 2014, we remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using\nan exchange rate of 10.8 bolivars per U.S. dollar, resulting in a charge of $226 million recorded in the line item other income (loss) \u2014 net in our consolidated statement of income.\nIn December 2014, due to the continued lack of liquidity and increasing economic uncertainty, the Company reevaluated the rate that should be used to remeasure the monetary assets and\nliabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2014, we determined that the SICAD 2 rate of 50 bolivars per U.S. dollar was the most appropriate legally available rate and\nremeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge of $146 million recorded in the line item other income (loss) \u2014 net in our consolidated statement of income.\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government replaced the SICAD 2 rate with a new open market exchange system, SIMADI. As a result of this change, management is currently evaluating\nwhich of the three legally available rates is the most appropriate to use for the remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary in the future. Our equity method investee\nthat has bottling operations in Venezuela is also evaluating which of these rates is the most appropriate to use for the remeasurement of the net monetary assets of their Venezuelan subsidiary in the\nfuture.\nIn addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiary's net monetary assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the\ncountry. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we\nexpect to realize upon the conversion of Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables, we recorded a write-down of $296 million recorded\nin the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income.\nWe also have certain U.S. dollar denominated intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. In January 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted a new law which imposes limits",
        "172": "We also have certain U.S. dollar denominated intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. In January 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted a new law which imposes limits\non profit margins earned in the country, reducing the Company's cash flows for as long as the law remains in effect. As a result of this law and the Company's revised expectations regarding the\nconvertibility of the local currency, we recognized an impairment charge of $18 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, recorded in the line item other operating charges in our\nconsolidated statement of income. Further government regulation or changes in exchange rates could result in additional impairments of these intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the combined value of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, the concentrate sales receivables from our bottling partner and the intangible assets\nassociated with products sold in Venezuela was $180 million. Included in this combined value is $52 million of cash and cash equivalents. Despite the additional currency conversion mechanisms,\nthe Company's ability to pay dividends from Venezuela is still restricted due to the low volume of U.S. dollars available for conversion. If the bolivar devalues further, it would likely result in our\nCompany recognizing additional foreign currency exchange losses, write-downs of receivables or impairment charges and our share of any charges recorded by our equity method investee.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of\nincreasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\n68",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market\nrisks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic",
        "176": "risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic\nexposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the\nvalue of the underlying exposure. The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in advance; however, the majority of our derivative instruments expire within 24 months or\nless. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.\nWe monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative\nfinancial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2014, we used 71 functional\ncurrencies and generated $26,235 million of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strength in\nother currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options (principally euros and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and\nliabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations.\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $23,553 million and $15,341 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This total includes derivative instruments",
        "177": "The total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $23,553 million and $15,341 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This total includes derivative instruments\nthat are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in an asset of $996 million as of\nDecember 31, 2014. At the end of 2014, we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created an unrealized loss of $103 million.\nThe fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in an asset of $221 million, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have increased our\nnet gains by $304 million.\n70",
        "178": "Interest Rates\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt\nversus long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nBased on the Company's variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2014, a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by\n$148 million in 2014. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income related to higher interest rates.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the\nCompany's investment policy. Our policy requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy limits the\namount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $57 million decrease in the fair market value of the portfolio.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We manage our exposure to\ncommodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution\nbusiness. We also use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks at times. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective\neconomic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle\nfleet.\nOpen commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $9 million and $26 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of\nstill beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. We own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic\nsparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200\ncountries.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling\npartners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers \u2014 the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 1.9 billion of the\napproximately 57 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n\u2022 beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate business\" or \"concentrate\noperations\"); and\n\u2022 finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product business\" or \"finished product\noperations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our\n\"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or combine the syrups\nwith sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers \u2014 such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles \u2014 bearing",

The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers \u2014 such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles \u2014 bearing\nour trademarks or trademarks licensed to us  and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for\nfountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use\nthe fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers.\nOur finished product operations consist primarily of Company-owned or -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations, including Coca-Cola Refreshments (\"CCR\"). Our Company-owned\nor -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations, other than CCR, are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. CCR is included in our North America operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-\ndrink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture\nfountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized\nfountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. In the United States, we authorize wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive\nappointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements",
        "188": "Basis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately\ndiffer from these estimates and assumptions.\n78",
        "189": "Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result.\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies, if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the\ninvestee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity\nmethod investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany\ntransactions.\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") and the\nintercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as VIEs for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate only\nbusiness enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation\n(ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not\ninvolve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business\nenterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must\nconsolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\nentity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.",
        "190": "entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in\nthese VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities,\nthey did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to\nthese VIEs totaled $2,274 million and $2,171 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans\nand guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result, we\nhave consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $266 million and $284 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013,\nrespectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nOur Company classifies long-lived assets or disposal groups to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the\naction, commits to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group; the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for\nsales of such assets or disposal groups; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset or disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the asset",

        "192": "We initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this\nmeasurement is recognized in the period in which the held-for-sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset or disposal group until the date of sale. We\nassess the fair value of a long-lived asset or disposal group less any costs to sell each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and report any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the\ncarrying value of the asset or disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the asset at the time it was initially classified as held for sale.\nUpon determining that a long-lived asset or disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports long-lived assets and/or the assets and liabilities of the disposal\ngroup, if material, in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 2.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is\nreasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. In particular,\ntitle usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except\nfor matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.\nDeductions from Revenue\nOur customers can earn certain incentives including, but not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for\ninfrastructure programs. The costs associated with these incentives are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income. For\ncustomer incentives that must be earned, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts earned and to",
        "193": "customer incentives that must be earned, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts earned and to\nbe recorded in deductions from revenue. In making these estimates, management considers past results. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates.\nIn some situations, the Company may determine it to be advantageous to make advance payments to specific customers to fund certain marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume\nand/or invest in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. The Company also makes advance payments to\ncertain customers for distribution rights. The advance payments made to customers are initially capitalized and included in our consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other assets and\nnoncurrent other assets, depending on the duration of the agreements. The assets are amortized over the applicable periods and included in deductions from revenue. The duration of these\nagreements typically ranges from 4 to 10 years.\nAmortization expense for infrastructure programs was $72 million, $69 million and $86 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the\nCompany in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were $7.0 billion, $6.9 billion and $6.1 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nAdvertising Costs\nOur Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the\nannual period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income were $3.5\nbillion, $3.3 billion and $3.3 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, advertising and production costs of $228 million and $363 million, respectively,\nwere primarily recorded in the line item prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFor interim reporting purposes, we allocate our estimated full year marketing expenditures that benefit multiple interim periods to each of our interim reporting periods.

We use the proportion of\neach interim period's actual unit case volume to the estimated full year unit case volume as the basis for the allocation. This methodology results in our marketing expenditures being recognized at\na standard rate per unit case. At the end of each interim reporting period, we review our estimated full year unit case volume and our estimated full year marketing expenditures in order to evaluate\nif a change in estimate is necessary. The impact of any changes in these full year estimates is recognized in the interim period in which the change in estimate occurs. Our full year marketing\nexpenditures are not impacted by this interim accounting policy.\n80",

Shipping and handling costs incurred to move finished goods from our sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in the line item selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded shipping and handling costs of\n$2.7 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses. Our customers do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs related\nto finished goods.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is\ncomputed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Approximately 38 million, 28 million and\n34 million stock option awards were excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, because the awards would have been antidilutive for the\nyears presented.\nCash Equivalents\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents. We manage our exposure to\ncounterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our credit risk concentrations.\nShort-Term Investments\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as short-term investments.\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\nWe use the equity method to account for our investments in equity securities if our investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the\ninvestee.

When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also\nperform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our investments in publicly traded\ncompanies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies\nincluding discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in\nevaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies.\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management determines if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other\nthan temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which\nthe market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to\nallow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nWe record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.

The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would\nuse. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any.

These territories border these bottlers' existing territories, allowing each bottler to better service local customers and provide more efficient execution. Through\nthe execution of comprehensive beverage agreements (\"CBAs\") with each of the bottlers, we granted certain exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of\nCompany-owned and licensed beverage products as defined by the CBA. Under the arrangement for these territories, CCR retains the rights to produce these beverage products, and the bottlers\nwill purchase from CCR substantially all of the related finished products needed in order to service the customers in these territories. Each CBA has a term of 10 years and is renewable by the\nbottler indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each. Under the CBA, the bottlers will make ongoing quarterly payments to CCR based on their future gross profit in these territories\nthroughout the term of the CBA, including renewals, in exchange for the grant of the exclusive territory rights.\nContemporaneously with the grant of these rights, the Company sold the distribution assets, certain working capital items, and the exclusive rights to distribute certain beverage brands not owned\nby the Company, but distributed by CCR, in each of these territories to the respective bottlers in exchange for cash.

We expect to recover the value of the intangible assets transferred to the bottlers under the CBAs through the\nfuture quarterly payments; however, as the payments for the territory rights are dependent on the bottlers' future gross profit in these territories, they are considered a form of contingent\nconsideration.\nThere is diversity in practice as it relates to the accounting for contingent consideration by the seller. The seller can account for the future contingent payments received as a gain contingency,\nrecognizing the amounts in the income statement only after the related contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized, which in this arrangement will be quarterly as the bottlers earn gross\nprofit in the transferred territories. Alternatively, the seller can record a receivable for the contingent consideration at fair value on the date of sale and record any future differences between the\npayments received and this receivable in the income statement as they occur. We elected the gain contingency treatment since the quarterly payments will be received throughout the terms of the\nCBAs, including all subsequent renewals, regardless of the cumulative amount received as compared to the value of the intangible assets transferred.\nPhilippine Bottling Operations\nOn December 13, 2012, the Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA executed a share purchase agreement for the sale of a majority ownership interest in our Philippine bottling operations.

Forward contracts and\ncommodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an\nagreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future.\nA collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future\ncash flows.

The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are\nimmediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company did not record any gains or losses into earnings as a result of the\ndiscontinuance of cash flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer expected to occur. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability\nin future cash flows is typically three years.\n94",
        "232": "The Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our eventual U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and U.S. dollar net cash\noutflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options (principally\neuros and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the\ndecline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in\nthe present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that have been designated\nand qualify for the Company's foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $13,224 million and $8,450 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in the cash flows of its euro-denominated debt due to changes in euro exchange\nrates. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. The Company records the change in carrying value of the euro-denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each\nperiod in the line item other income (loss) \u2014 net in our consolidated statement of income. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded into AOCI with an\nimmediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in the euro exchange rates. These swaps have a notional amount of $2,590 million as of\nDecember 31, 2014.\nThe Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials\nused in our manufacturing process. The derivative instruments have been designated and qualify as part of the Company's commodity cash flow hedging program.

Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the plan.

During 2012, the Company revised the asset allocation targets and restructured the investment manager composition to further diversify investment risk and reduce volatility while\nmaintaining our long-term return objectives. Our revised target allocation is a mix of 42 percent equity investments, 30 percent fixed-income investments and 28 percent alternative investments.\nWe believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n(1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of\nrisk;\n(2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers;\nand\n(3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset\nclass.\nThe guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and\nineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Unless exceptions have been approved, investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling\ncommodities, futures or option contracts, as well as from short selling of securities. Additionally, investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style\nor guidelines.

Optimal\nreturns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in the common stock of our Company\naccounted for approximately 5 percent of our global equities allocation and approximately 2 percent of total U.S. plan assets. Our investments in global equities are intended to provide diversified\nexposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small- and mid-cap equities are expected to experience larger swings in their\nmarket value on a periodic basis. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\nOur target allocation of 30 percent fixed-income investments is composed of 33 percent long-duration bonds and 67 percent with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds\nprovide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to mitigate duration and credit\nexposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market debt.

Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are\nprioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to\nmeasure fair value are as follows:\n\u2022\nLevel 1 \u2014 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities.\n\u2022\nLevel 2 \u2014 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1.

Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the Company's fair value hedging strategy.\nInvestments in Trading and Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance sheet\ndate and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or\nnonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar\ndata. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the closing contract\nprice as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public markets,\nor can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments other than futures\ninclude the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard valuation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input.\nThe discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.",

The\nCompany recognized a noncash loss of $494 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of writing down the assets to their fair value less costs to sell.

Refer to Note 2.\n2 The Company recognized losses of $18 million and $195 million during years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to impairment charges on certain intangible assets.

The fair value of the assets was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs. Refer to\nNote 1 and Note 17.\n3 In 2014, the Company recognized a loss of $32 million as a result of the owners of the majority interest in certain Brazilian bottling operations exercising their option to acquire from us a 10 percent interest in\nthe entity's outstanding shares. The exercise price was lower than our carrying value. This loss was determined using Level 3 inputs. In 2013, the Company recognized a gain of $139 million as a result of\nCoca-Cola FEMSA, an equity method investee, issuing additional shares of its own stock at a per share amount greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share investment.
